# Lab 5 - Starter
Lab Participants: Srujam Dave
1. You wouldn't use a unit test to test the message feature of an application. The unit tests are intended
   for individual funcitons or components, and the message feature involves multiple functions or 
   independent parts.
2. You would use a unit test to test the max length feature, as it presumably involves a single check
   or is entirely contained within a single function.
